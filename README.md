## Capstone-project
   
   In a capitalistic world, we know that there is a lot of saturation in many markets. The
fundamental housing-needs market is no different. Basement systems is a leading provider of
consumer needs for home repair in all aspects, especially on the east coast. There is a lot of
potential for the company to expand its growth and provide its services to regions in which their
services are not yet provided. There are also opportunities for new lines of business which will
complement the potential growth of Basement Systems associations.

   The purpose of the project is to provide Basement Systems some insights into their
current state of business by analyzing the company data provided, identifying factors like climate
and demographics which can potentially influence the demand for services offered by Basement
Systems, and providing meaningful recommendations based on the analysis. Ultimately, the
analysis is to help Treehouse Internet Group improve quality of the services that they provide
and perhaps expand to new areas.

   Both internal and external data was analyzed to find a potential correlation between
various factors and the demand for services offered by the Basement Systemâ€™s association, which
in turn, determined the increase in the number of leads. The trend and seasonality of the demand
were also studied. Additionally, sentiment analysis has been performed on the customer reviews
for different services associated with Treehouse. Some recommendations have been provided
based on these findings.
